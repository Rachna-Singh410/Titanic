# Titanic
This project is to predict the number of person how many pepole survived in this disaster. Here I used logistic regression to predict the result. First I read the data set and after that I trained my model and calculate the classification report, confusion matrix and accuracy.

### Prerequisites
Some python libraries
```
pandas 
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot etc.
```
### Installing
```
pip install library_name
```
### Dataset
I took the dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/hesh97/titanicdataset-traincsv. In this dataset there are 12 columns e.g. passanger, survived, class, age, Name, sex, ticket etc.
